- Customisable Password Criteria: Users can specify the length of the password and choose to include special characters, numeric characters, lowercase letters, and uppercase letters.
- Randomised Password Generation: The tool generates a randomised password based on the selected criteria.
- User-Friendly Interface: The password can be generated by clicking a button on the webpage, and the generated password is displayed in an alert and within an input field.
